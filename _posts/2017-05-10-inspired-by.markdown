<p>It's only fair to reference the presentations that I like to reference when building Keynote Extractor.</p>
<p>They are "<a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/delivering-responsibly.html">delivering responsibly</a>" by Scott Jehl, and by Maciej Ceglowski's <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/">talks</a>.</p>
<p>The display of these presentations was hand crafted by their authors. Part of the selling proposition of Keynote Extractor (KEX) is to automate part of the process of sharing a presentation.
