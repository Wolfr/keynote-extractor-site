<p>There's a new feature in Keynote Extractor: responsive images. When you export your slides you have the option to activate the responsive images option.</p>
<p>This will optimize the exported slide images so there are 3 different versions: a small, medium and large version. Within the HTML we are using <a href="https://responsiveimages.org/">responsive images</a> to provide a speedier page load and less bandwidth waste, especially on mobile.</p>
