I am working on the the upcoming 1.1 version of Keynote Extractor is coming up, and one of the features we have is JSON export.

When I was designing 1.1 I briefly pondered about the export options and settled on XML and JSON. But the more I thought about it the more I wondered whether XML was actually useful. I certainly wouldn't want to use it. And a developery person could easily convert JSON to XML themselves.

I decided to cut the feature. I was happy to listen to Manton Reece in <a href="https://www.coreint.org/">CoreInt</a> talking about his work on <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON feed</a>.

This further reaffirmed my thoughts. XML is dead, long live JSON!
