Unfortunately, there is a breaking bug when you use Keynote 7.3.1 with Keynote Extractor 1.1. The order of the slide images gets jumbled.

We are aware of this issue and are investigating a fix.

The temporary workaround is to manually fix the references in the HTML template; or to use an older version of Keynote.
