# [HTML Extractor for Keynote Website](http://keynote-extractor.com)

We are using Hashi ( https://github.com/Dietr/hashi-boilerplate ) here but some old version without proper documentation. A lot has changed and I'm going to put this site on Wordpress anyway.

If you need instructions ask Johan.

### Install

`sh install.sh`
