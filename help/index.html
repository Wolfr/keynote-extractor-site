<h3>How to use Keynote Extractor (1.1)</h3>

<p>Drop a .keynote file onto the application. Keynote Extractor will start extracting your slides to HTML.</p>

<p>In order to do so, we need to launch the presentation in Keynote. Check out this video to see how it works:</p>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>Use the options in the <em>Preferences</em> window to customize your output.</p>

<p>Access the Preferences by clicking the cog wheel (<img src="../img/cog.png" width="13">) or by the shortcut <code>âŒ˜,</code>.</p>

<h4>Theme</h4>

<p>This changes the colors your output. Choose between <strong>Dark Grey</strong>, <strong>Black</strong> and <strong>White</strong>.</p>

<h4>Type</h4>

<p>This changes the type of output. Choose between <strong>web page</strong> and <strong>slideshow</strong>. A web page is just a long scrolling web page with the images and text side by side. A slideshow has the slides one by one, with keyboard shortcuts to navigate between slides, and the option to toggle notes on and off.</p>

<h4>Output formats</h4>

<p>This allows you to output your slides as JSON in addition to the HTML output. The JSON format is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    "notes" : "      &lt;p&gt;Escaped HTML here&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n",
    "image" : "images\/images.001.jpg"
  }
]</code></pre>

<p>If you use the responsive images functionality, the format is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    "notes" : "      &lt;p&gt;Escaped HTML here&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n",
    "image" : "images\/images.001.jpg",
    "images" : {
      "md" : "images\/images.001-md.jpg",
      "lg" : "images\/images.001-lg.jpg",
      "sm" : "images\/images.001-sm.jpg"
    }
  }
]</code></pre>

<h4>Responsive images</h4>

<p>This allows you to output a set of 3 images for every slide, to optimize the slide output on mobile. For every slide, 3 images will be generated, with 3 different widths: 984, 728 and 375. These are used in <a href="https://responsiveimages.org/">responsive images</a> code using the <code>srcset</code> attribute. Browser heuristics then determine which images to load.</p>

<h3>App from an Unidentified Developer</h3>

<p>When you download Keynote Extractor, you might need to give the application your permission to run.</p>

<p>Keynote Extractor needs broad access to your system to be able to create folders in the most user-friendly way (i.e. right where your presentation is, without asking for a file location). Apple provides a way to sandbox applications so they work in more secure ways. We believe that we can't provide the right user experience if we sandbox the application.</p>
